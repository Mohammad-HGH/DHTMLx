# Description
After a lot of searching on Google, unfortunately we could not find the Persian calendar plugin for DHTMLX. This became an excuse for our week-long effort to write this DHTMLX with a Persian calendar!
In this program, we can enter a new project or new task with a solar date (Jalali) and view and check the diagram and length of the project as solar days.
This project also has an RTL version that will be presented in later versions
